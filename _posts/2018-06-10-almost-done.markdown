# Almost Done!

I have just finished my last day of Spring Quarter 2018. Only one Quarter left! I am a little sad that my goal of graduating with a Bachelor's Degree before I turn 20 isn't a reality but I will only be a couple months away from that goal. I am excited to start freelancing this Summer and continuing with the Magpie Project Remotely. I am hoping to do some logo design and website design for my friends who have just recently graduated.
