# Almost Done!

I have just finished my last day of Spring Quarter 2018, all my finals are turned in. Only one Quarter left! I am a little sad that my goal of graduating with a Bachelor's Degree before I turn 20 isn't a reality but I will only be a couple months away from that goal. I am excited to start freelancing this Summer and continuing with the Magpie Project remotely from the West Side. I am hoping to do some logo design and website design for my friends who have just recently graduated. I am also doing a continuation of my last web class into this summer and I am excited to do more up and coming web advancements, like progressive web apps and content management systems. 

I am looking forward to Winter Quarter when I will be taking my final Senior classes like Senior Capstone and Portfolio
